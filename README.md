# Unhinged
A text based dating app. 

This is the description provided by the school.

"The NachenSmall Software Corporation, which has traditionally only built software for running senior-citizen bingo games, has decided to pivot into a new area. They’ve decided to disrupt the online matchmaking market and build a new dating app called... Unhinged.

The evil co-CEOs, Carey and David (not to be confused with Harry and David, the purveyors of yummy gourmet gift baskets) have become increasingly frustrated with today’s superficial, picture-filled dating apps and have decided to create a text-only dating app to help people focus on what’s really most important—compatibility."

Very deceiving considering the difficulty of this project. Unhinged was created in Winter 2022 for UCLA's CS32 Project 4. The software used was C++.
